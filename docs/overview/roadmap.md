# Overlock Network Roadmap

_Updated: Q4 2025_  
Overlock Network evolves from a concept for decentralized infrastructure management into a functioning blockchain ecosystem connecting AI agents, users, and providers.

---

## 2024 Q1 — Concept and Research
The foundation of Overlock Network was established as a conceptual model for a decentralized control-plane network capable of managing infrastructure through blockchain transactions.

- [x] Define the idea of decentralized infrastructure orchestration for AI agents and human users.  
- [x] Outline the core architecture for blockchain-controlled environments.  
- [x] Set principles for verifiable control, agent autonomy, and secure configuration management.

---

## 2024 Q2 — Local Development Tools
Focus on building developer tools for local experimentation with control planes and resource configurations.

- [x] Release the first **Overlock CLI** to run Crossplane Control Planes locally.  
- [x] Achieve adoption by the **Crossplane community** for local development and testing.  
- [x] Introduce the internal configuration schema and registry for agent-based environments.

---

## 2024 Q4 — Blockchain Foundation
Transitioned from local development tools to blockchain infrastructure. Built the base layer for decentralized coordination.

- [x] Start development of the **Overlock Node** and **API** using the **Cosmos SDK**.  
- [x] Implement modules for configuration lifecycle, environments, and transaction state.  
- [x] Prepare the initial blockchain modules for integration with Provider CLI tools.

---

## 2025 Q1 — Network Integration
Integrated blockchain transactions into control-plane automation and expanded the CLI’s network capabilities.

- [x] Add the **Network Subscribe Plugin** to the Provider CLI.  
  - [x] Enable automatic creation of Crossplane environments based on network transactions.  
  - [x] Allow installation of configurations and execution of control-plane actions via blockchain events.  
- [x] Complete Provider testing and reconciliation through CLI-based execution.

---

## 2025 Q2 — Web Console and Devnet Preparation
Introduced a web interface to visualize configurations and monitor network activity.

- [x] Start development of the **Web Console** (May 12 2025).  
- [x] Connect the Web Console directly to the network APIs of devnet.  

---

## 2025 Q3 — MCP Layer, NFT Marketplace, and Devnet Deployment
Expanded the network into multi-provider coordination with a dedicated orchestration layer and NFT-based resource exchange.

- [x] **Deploy the first functional devnet (July 26 2025).**  
- [x] **Complete the MCP Server** for remote execution of control-plane logic (August 13 2025).  
- [x] **Launch Overlock Space**, the NFT marketplace for **Energy** and **Config NFTs** (September 2025).

---

## 2025 Q4 — Provider Runtime and TEE Controllers
Focus on enabling infrastructure providers to participate securely and preparing for the first public testnet.

- [ ] Develop the **Provider Running Tool** for onboarding and managing provider nodes.  
- [ ] Implement **TEE-based (Trusted Execution Environment)** controllers for secure operations.  
- [ ] Finalize integration tests and network security audits.  
- [ ] Prepare for **public testnet** deployment.

---

## 2026 Q1 — Public Testnet
Public rollout of the Overlock Network with on-chain governance and agent participation.

- [ ] Launch the **Overlock Testnet** with multi-provider support.  
- [ ] Enable provider onboarding, developer registration, and governance participation.  
- [ ] Release public faucet, network explorer, and telemetry dashboards.

---

## 2026 Q2 — Token and Economic Layer
Establish the financial and incentive model for network sustainability and provider economics.

- [ ] Introduce the **Overlock Token** for payments, staking, and governance.  
- [ ] Implement provider reward and settlement mechanisms.  
- [ ] Enable **IBC integration** for cross-chain compatibility and liquidity.

---

## Beyond 2026 — Ecosystem Growth
Overlock transitions into a self-sustaining ecosystem of intelligent agents and providers.

- [ ] Expand integrations to include **IoT**, **SaaS**, and **DePIN** resource providers.  
- [ ] Add AI-driven agents capable of autonomous orchestration and cost optimization.  
- [ ] Enable **cross-chain settlements** and **zk-proof validation** for control-plane actions.  
- [ ] Continue to evolve toward a verifiable, self-orchestrating global infrastructure network.
