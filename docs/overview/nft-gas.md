Gas NFTs (Execution Credit Containers) are digital containers that store execution credit.  
They allow you to run and maintain Active Resources in the network by holding a prepaid balance of resource tokens.

These tokens are securely stored on a dedicated account linked to the NFT.  
You don’t need to manage this account directly — the system handles everything automatically during usage.

## 🎯 What a Gas NFT Does

If you hold a Gas NFT, it means you have fuel to power your infrastructure.

Whenever you create or use an Active Resource, the system checks the available credit and deducts what’s needed from the linked account.

## 🔁 Using and Reusing

You can use a Gas NFT until its credit is fully spent.  
You can also transfer it to someone else — they’ll get access to the remaining gas.

There’s no need to refill or adjust anything manually. If you need more gas, simply get another NFT or receive one from someone else.

## 🔄 Flexible and Transferable

Gas NFTs are easy to trade, gift, or bundle with other types of NFTs.  
For example, you might receive a configuration and gas together as part of a setup pack.

As long as the NFT still holds credit, it can be used by whoever owns it.

## 💡 Types of Gas NFTs

Some Gas NFTs might include additional features:

- **Nitro Packs** for high-performance access
- **Promo Drops** with bonus fuel
- **Timed Fuel** that expires if not used by a certain date

These variations let users choose the right kind of gas for their needs.

## ✅ Summary

A Gas NFT is your prepaid fuel card for the network.  
It connects to a special account that holds your resource credit, which is used automatically as you create and run Active Resources.

You stay in control — just hold it, use it, or pass it on.  
When it’s empty, get a new one and keep going.
